# What is it? #

With this script the actors can only attack and/or do specific skills if they have enough ammo in the inventory. The designer can set every weapon to use it's very own unique ammo count and ammo easily via the options at the top.

# Features #
1. Each weapon can use a different amount of ammo (Say a shotgun fires 5 rather then a pistol which fires 1)
2. Each weapon can have it's own ammo
3. Easily define skills that require ammo and the amount of ammo needed
4. Skills use the current equipped weapons ammo rather then a defined value.
